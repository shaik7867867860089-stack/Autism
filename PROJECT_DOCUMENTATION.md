## 🎯 1. Project Objectives

### Primary Goal
To empower frontline health workers (Anganwadi) with an AI-driven "Virtual Specialist" that can instantly interpret complex developmental scores (DQ) and initiate clinical pathways for children at risk of Autism and related neurodevelopmental disorders.

### Core Pillars
- **Standardization**: Digitizing the Developmental Quotient (DQ) assessment process across 5 domains (Gross Motor, Fine Motor, Language, Cognitive, Socio-Emotional).
- **Explainability**: Using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide the "Clinical Why" behind every AI prediction, ensuring transparency for parents and specialists.
- **Longitudinal Trajectory**: Predicting risk escalation (Model B) by analyzing changes in developmental scores over time.
- **Data-Driven Policy**: Providing state and district health officers with real-time analytics to allocate specialist resources efficiently.

## 🤖 4. AI & Machine Learning Pipeline

### 4.1 Feature Engineering (The Clinical Logic)
The system doesn't just look at raw scores; it creates advanced clinical indices:

| Index | Definition | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **SCII** | Social Communication Impairment Index | Merges Language and Socio-Emotional deficits to isolate core Autism markers. |
| **NSI** | Neurodevelopmental Severity Index | A normalized burden score (0-1) reflecting absolute developmental delay. |
| **ERM** | Environmental Risk Modifier | Accounts for protective factors like caregiver engagement and language exposure. |
| **DBS** | Delay Burden Score | The ratio of delayed domains (e.g., 3 out of 5 domains delayed = 0.6). |
| **Longitudinal Deltas** | ΔDQ, ΔBehavior | Measures the speed of developmental change between assessment cycles. |

### 4.2 Visual Performance Dashboard

The system's models are calibrated for clinical safety (high sensitivity to ensure no child is missed).

#### Comprehensive Performance (Model A)
![Evaluation Dashboard](https://github.com/shaik7867867860089-stack/Autism/blob/main/classifier/evaluation_dashboard.png)
- **ROC-AUC (0.66+)**: Robust ability to distinguish between high and low risk cases.
- **Calibration**: Platt Scaling ensures that a "75% High Risk" prediction truly reflects a 75% observed risk in the population.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Optimized to minimize false negatives in clinical screening.

#### Training Efficiency
![Learning Curves](https://github.com/shaik7867867860089-stack/Autism/blob/main/classifier/learning_curves.png)
- **Error Convergence**: Training and validation logs show a stable model that generalizes well to new, unseen children.
- **Consistency**: High performance across varied age groups (18-60 months).

#### AI Global Transparency
![SHAP Global Summary](https://github.com/shaik7867867860089-stack/Autism/blob/main/classifier/learning_curves.png)
- **Language_DQ & Socio_Emotional_DQ**: These are the strongest global drivers, confirming that communication deficits are the primary indicators of risk in this population.
- **Feature Impact**: SHAP summarizes how each individual DQ score pushes the "needle" toward high or low risk.

#### Field Validation
![Field Accuracy](https://github.com/shaik7867867860089-stack/Autism/blob/main/classifier/shap_summary.png)
- Visualization of the actual distribution of developmental quotients captured from the field implementation, validating the model's environment.

## 🔐 6. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a **Jurisdictional Boundary Policy** where permissions are inherited downward but data access is strictly gated.

### 6.1 Role Hierarchy & Responsibilities

| Tier | Role | Access Bound | Key Dashboard Responsibilities |
|------|------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **L1** | **System Admin** | **Global** | User management, global audit logs, system-wide configuration. |
| **L2** | **State Admin** | **Whole State** | State-level heatmaps, cross-district comparisons, policy evaluation. |
| **L3** | **District Officer** | **One District** | Referral success monitoring, specialist clinic coordination. |
| **L4** | **Supervisor** | **One Mandal** | Performance auditing for AWCs, training needs identification. |
| **L5** | **AW Worker** | **One AWC** | Enrollment, DQ assessment scoring, direct parent counseling. |
| **L6** | **Parent** | **Own Child** | Accessing the child's growth chart and daily home intervention tasks. |

> [!TIP]
> **Data Privacy**: A Worker from AWC "A" can never witness the records of a child in AWC "B", even within the same Mandal, ensuring localized privacy.

## 🔧 7. Technical Implementation Flow

### 7.1 Backend Logic (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens generated upon login include the `user_role` and `jurisdiction_id` (e.g., `district_id`).
- **Authorization**: Middleware intercepts requests:
  ```python
  if user.role == 'district_officer':
      query = query.filter(models.Child.district_id == user.district_id)
  ```
- **ML Integration**: The `ML_MODEL_PATH` in `.env` points to the latest pickle files. Upon assessment POST, the backend triggers `AutismRiskClassifier.predict_with_stratification`.

### 7.2 Frontend Logic (React + Vite)
- **Role-Based Sidebars**: The sidebar calculates available modules based on the `user.role` from the Redux/Context state.
- **Analytics**: `Analytics.jsx` fetches data from the `district_summary` table to render charts efficiently without recalculating 22k rows.
- **Intervention UI**: Displays "Daily Activity Steps" in Telugu, derived from the SHAP interpretation logic.
