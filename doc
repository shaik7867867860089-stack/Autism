# 8. Hybrid Clinical Rule Engine

To ensure scientific validity, rule-based safeguards are integrated.

Example:

If:
- Language DQ < 70  
- Socio-Emotional DQ < 75  
- Age > 24 months  

Then:
Minimum classification = Medium Risk  

This prevents under-classification of vulnerable children.

# 2️⃣ Mathematical Formulation Section

This section makes your proposal look highly professional and technically strong.

---

# Mathematical Formulation of the AI Models

---

## 2.1 Notation

Let:

- \( i \) = child index  
- \( t \) = assessment time  
- \( X_i^t \) = feature vector for child \( i \) at time \( t \)  
- \( Y_i^t \) = risk category at time \( t \)  
- \( P(Y_i^t) \) = predicted probability distribution  

---

# 2.2 Feature Vector Definition

Each child at time \( t \) is represented as:

\[
X_i^t =
\{
DQ_{GM}, DQ_{FM}, DQ_{LC}, DQ_{COG}, DQ_{SE},
N_i, B_i, E_i, A_i
\}
\]

Where:

- \( DQ_{*} \) = Developmental Quotient per domain  
- \( N_i \) = Nutrition Risk Index  
- \( B_i \) = Neuro-Behavioral Risk Index  
- \( E_i \) = Environmental Risk Index  
- \( A_i \) = Age and demographic variables  

---

# 2.3 Model A – Multi-Class Risk Classification

We define:

\[
Y_i^t \in \{0,1,2,3\}
\]

Where:

- 0 = Low  
- 1 = Medium  
- 2 = High  
- 3 = Critical  

Using XGBoost, the predicted probability is:

\[
P(Y_i^t = k | X_i^t) =
\frac{e^{f_k(X_i^t)}}{\sum_{j=0}^{3} e^{f_j(X_i^t)}}
\]

Final classification:

\[
\hat{Y}_i^t = \arg\max_k P(Y_i^t = k | X_i^t)
\]

Loss Function:

Multi-class log loss:

\[
L = - \sum_{i} \sum_{k=0}^{3}
y_{ik} \log P(Y_i^t = k)
\]

---

# 2.4 Model B – Future Risk Escalation

We define escalation target:

\[
Z_i^{t+1} =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } Y_i^{t+1} \geq High \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Feature set includes time deltas:

\[
\Delta DQ = DQ_i^{t+1} - DQ_i^t
\]

\[
\Delta Delay = Delay_i^{t+1} - Delay_i^t
\]

Binary classification probability:

\[
P(Z_i^{t+1} = 1 | X_i^t)
= \sigma(f(X_i^t))
\]

Where:

\[
\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\]

Binary cross-entropy loss:

\[
L = - \sum_i
[ Z_i \log P_i + (1 - Z_i)\log(1 - P_i) ]
\]

---

# 2.5 Explainability (SHAP)

Each prediction is decomposed as:

\[
f(X_i) = \phi_0 + \sum_{j=1}^{M} \phi_j
\]

Where:

- \( \phi_j \) = contribution of feature \( j \)  
- \( \phi_0 \) = base prediction  

This ensures full transparency of predictions.
